 repair_3_desc:0 "Using draft animals, larger and larger blocks of cut stone can be transported longer and longer distances in shorter and shorter periods of time, drasrtically improving repair times."
 construction_l4:0 "Fired Brick"
 construction_l4_desc:0 "As hard as stone, but much easier to transport, fired brick marries the ease of contstruction with mud bricks and the sturdiness of stone construction by using clay ovens to bring bricks to much hotter temperatures than their sun dried predecessors."
 construction_r4:0 "Arched Roofs"
 construction_r4_desc:0 "The development of arched roofs, made possible by the much smaller fired bricks, allow buildings to be built entirely of one material and cuts out the need for waiting until harvest time for thatch to finish a roof."
 repair_4:0 "Lime Mortar"
 repair_4_desc:0 "By incorporating crushed limestone into mortar, the mortar both lasts longer and has a stronger binding effect, making repairs both less necessary and cheaper."
 construction_l5:0 "Standardized Brickmaking"
 construction_l5_desc:0 "Official state monopolization of brickmaking standardizes size, shape, and process. New buildings can now be constructed in the exact size and shape, so fewer locations are wasted on failed projects due to missing materials."
 construction_r5:0 "Concrete"
 construction_r5_desc:0 "When the newly invented cement is mixed with smaller stones and bits of crushed brick it sets into a stone like substance that can be used to fit into spaces for which bricks can not easily be made or stones can not easily be cut." 
 repair_5:0 "Cement"
 repair_5_desc:0 "Adding volcanic ash to lime mortar makes it set much faster and even underwater. Construction and repairs can now procede even in rain and in areas that do not recieve direct sunlight." 
 construction_l6:0 "Geometric Design"
 construction_l6_desc:0 "A new specialty field called architecture emerges that allows builders to use sketches and designs to plan a building before it is constructed. Buildings grow taller and wider as a result."
 construction_r6:0 "Cranes"
 construction_r6_desc:0 "A simple machine turned complex through impressive engineering, these construction cranes can swivel in any direction and carry heavy objects wherever they need to go."
 repair_6:0 "Jointed Construction"
 repair_6_desc:0 "Stacking bricks in an offset pattern, rather than one on top of the other, means that when cracks form in the building, they are not able to run the length of the structure and repairs only need to be made to inch long cracks, rather than entire walls."
 construction_l7:0 "Scaffolding"
 construction_l7_desc:0 "The use of wooden beams both internall and externally allows for even larger buildings, which can house more and more manufacturing materials and workers."
 construction_r7:0 "Domed Roofs"
 construction_r7_desc:0 "Arches have long been used to stabilize doorways and underground rooms, but the inovation of fully circular domes expands further the stability of roofs and cuts down on construction time used to stabilize structures."
 repair_7:0 "Blown Glass"
 repair_7_desc:0 "Standardized glass blowing by artisans allows windows, which up until this point were either filled with translucent stone or less sturdy poured glass, to be mass produced, making them easily replaceable."
 construction_l8:0 "Steel Supports"
 construction_l8_desc:0 "With the mass production of steel, the skelatons of buildings can now be made of metal and they can now be build much wider without sacrificing structural integrity."

 production_2:0 "Bronze Alloy"
 production_2_desc:0 "The exploitation of copper and tin outcroppings above ground lead to the discovery of a new alloy we call bronze, this metal makes tools and weapons more durable than mere copper, so each weapon produced is worth considerably more than before."
 naval_2:0 "Pitch Construction"
 naval_2_desc:0 "By replacing leather straps with pitch, ships become even more water tight. The newly assembled ships are both cheaper, since one barrel of pitch is easier to collect than several animal hides."

 naval_7:0 "Ironclad"
 naval_7_desc:0 "The newly cheap steel and the practice of iron reinforcement lead to a natural conclusion: steel ships. Current wooden ships are clad in steel, but new ships are produced entirely in steel, yet they are cheaper than having to chop down an entire forest for one ship."

 wood_2:0 "Iron Axes"
 wood_2_desc:0 "Iron axes are significantly more resistent and keep a sharp edge for far longer than their bronze predecessors. This frees up a lot of time that used to be wasted sharpening the edge of the axes, and turns it into productive logging."
 stone_2:0 "Metal Drills"
 stone_2_desc:0 "Improvements in metalworking lead to the widespread use of metal tools. Cheif among them are metal drills, which are used to bore holes in cliff faces, which can then be wedged open to split the rock away from its source."
 storage_2:0 "Record Keeping"

 storage_3:0 "Salting and Smoking"
 storage_3_desc:0 "As mines move deeper and deeper into the earth, large deposits of salt are found that dwarf the above ground salt licks. Abundant salt makes the preservation of meat for winter easier and food more abundant even in the colder months."
 farming_3:0 "Irrigation"
 farming_3_desc:0 "Benders channel rivers, lakes, and streams, so that farmers no longer have to rely on the often unpredictable and sometimes deadly flooding to water their crops, so harvests are more frequent and less costly."
 food_3:0 "Crop Specialization"
 food_3_desc:0 "Until now, farmers settled on hills and those settled in rich river valleys have been cultivating the same crops to feed their local villages, but trade allows them to specialize in crops better suited to individual climes, which can then be traded for other necessities."
 tanning_3:0 "Animals Hunting Animals"
 tanning_3_desc:0 "Having mastered the taming of beasts of burden and game, hunters move on to taming a new class of animals: pets. By taming predators, hunters are able to use their newfound friends to track other wild game they have not yet tamed, increasing the variety of pelts available."
 mining_3:0 "Tunneling"

 farming_4:0 "Fertilization"
 farming_4_desc:0 "Farmers who both grow crops and raise animals find that fields closest to their animal pens produce the most abundant crops. The link between manure and crop growth is quickly made and sewing fields with manure becomes a widespread practice."
 food_4:0 "Agricultural Exchange"
 food_4_desc: "Trade among villages leads to further diversification of crops some of which seem even better suited to grow in their new homes than in their original habitats. Some crops even grow well together, boosting each other's productivity."
 tanning_4:0 "Fur Trade"

 wood_5:0 "The Lumber Mill"
 wood_5_desc:0 "A much larger version of the water mills used to crush ores and grains, water is used here to turn saw blades that turn logs into wooden planks in minutes, reducing the number of carpenters needed to process a tree significantly."
 stone_5:0 "Reinforced Wheeled Carts"
 stone_5_desc:0 "Wheeled carts used to transport grain and water were not quite up to the task of carrying stone until metal banding reinforcing the wheels and the undercairage let carts transport stone miles inland from the barges."
 storage_5:0 "Pickling"
 storage_5_desc:0 "The new fermented substances have proven doubly useful. When they are used to store food, both they and the food last longer, even if the food then takes on an odd tangy taste."
 farming_5:0 "Metal Plows"
 farming_5_desc:0 "One of the newly cheap metal tools is the plowshear. Up until now, plows have either been made of stone or wood and were useful, at most, for one season. New metal plows are both faster and longer lasting, freeing up farmers to til even more fields."
 food_5:0 "Selective Breeding"
 food_5_desc:0 "Farmers have been replanting the heartiest crop varieties for generations, but a recent discovery about the way that plants reproduce now allows them to breed plants with complementary attributes, creating entire new hybrid species."
 tanning_5:0 "Enclosure"
 tanning_5_desc:0 "The rapid expansion of animal raising in the new flourishing fur encomy has caused many disputes between ranchers about where farm animals will be allowed to graze. The enclosure of certain stretches of land with fences settles these disputes and stabilizes the animal market."
 mining_5:0 "Drilling and Blasting"
 mining_5_desc:0 "Some areas are simply not economically viable to dig into with tools alone. With the use of controlled explosions, long tunnels can be carved out of hard rock to reach resource-rich areas."
 mining_c5:0 "Mechanized Mining"
 mining_c5_desc:0 "New machines, some of them powered by the very coal that they mine, can carve out even the most hardened rock, allowing mining corporations to return to old mines long thought tapped out and remove any remaing traces of valuable coal."
 textile_5:0 "Spinning Jenny"
 textile_5_desc:0 "A significant improvement on the traditional spinning wheel, the spinning jenny increases the productivity of each worker nearly 10 fold. Spinning can now keep pace with the increased speed of weaving and even outpaces it in some places."
 stone_6:0 "Metal Wire"
 stone_6_desc:0 "Cooled with water and spun specifically for this purpose, metal wire, initially strung between two pieces of wood but eventually run through a steam turbine, can cut through even marble in seconds."
 storage_6:0 "Jellying"
 storage_6_desc:0 "By cooking food within materials that solidify into a gel, it can not only be preserved, but can also be eaten as is with little preparation."
 storage_7:0 "Canning"
 storage_7_desc:0 "Blown glass jars with metal tops and honey or wax seals are capable of keeping food fresh for years, if not decades. When mixed with pickling, this process has even been known to keep food edible for generations."
 storage_8:0 "Freeze Drying"
 storage_8_desc:0 "Food that is repeatedly exposed to freezing temperatures and drained of all water can reach a dried state, and once canned, can last several decades."
 farming_6:0 "Mechanized Harvesting" 
 farming_6_desc:0 "Harvesters, hand powered seed drills, and even coal powered tractors all cut the need for manual labor to til fields and speed up harvests, allowing some farmers to grow two rounds of crops per season."
 food_6:0 "Crop Rotation"
 food_6_desc:0 "Even the most successful farmers have to leave some of their fields fallow once every several seasons, but that is costly, especially if the off season falls in a good year. By rotating in nitrogen fixing crops in, farmers can use every field in every season, doubling productivity."
 tanning_6:0 "Artificial Breeding"
 tanning_6_desc:0 "While it may seem a simple fact that animal husbandry depends directly on the natural reproductive cycle of the animals being raised, farmers discover that with special attention, animals can be artificially bred at a much faster rate, so there is little fear of depleting species entirely."
 mining_6:0 "Strip Mining"
 mining_6_desc:0 "New mechanical diggers powered by steam engine are able to remove tons of dirt and rock a minute. To some this sounds like a return to pit mining, but those that witness it up close equate it more to moving entire mountians. While once only benders could acomplish such feats, now any man with the right machine is capable."
 mining_c6:0 "Rail Construction"
 mining_c6_desc:0 "Coal mining companies have both abundant access to coal and a need to transport it. Steam engines fitted to rail carts are able to pull cars a much greater distances than pack animals, opening the world up to coal fired machines."
 textile_6:0 "Industrial Weaving"
 textile_6_desc:0 "The mass production of weaving and spinning tools allows some wealthy business owners to accumulate massive troves of machines and then employ workers, many of them the former owners of smaller textile businesses, to produce unprecedented amounts of cloth."
 smelting_1:0 "Steelworks"
 smelting_1_desc:0 "Hot burning coal and finely ground ores combine much more easily than did charcoal and raw iron in olden times. Steel can now be mass produced in massive furnaces capable of melting hundreds of tones of ore at a time and molding it into ingots for distribution."
 smelting_2:0 "Cold Rolled Steel"
 smelting_2_desc:0 "The industrial process of producing steel by cooling it instantaneously rather than by working the metal until it cools. The resultant steel is far stronger and requires far less manpower and material."
 smelting_3:0 "Open-Hearth Steelmaking"
 smelting_3_desc:0 "By leaving one side of the molten steel open to the air, benders can ad different ingredients as needed. Now steel can be produced with lower grade materials mixed with balancing adatives, making it both cheaper and less wasteful."
 smelting_l1:0 "Standardized Machinery"
 smelting_l1_desc:0 "With all smelting machines standardized across all manufacturies, very little training is required before a laborer can produce reasonable quality steal quickly, greatly expanding the workforce and increasing production while minimizing waste."
 smelting_r1:0 "Vertical Integration"
 smelting_r1_desc:0 "Rather than focus on increasing the efficiency of production methods, some smelters choose instead to buy up mines and mills to ensure a steady, cheap supply of iron and coal, making high quality steel incredibly cheap."
